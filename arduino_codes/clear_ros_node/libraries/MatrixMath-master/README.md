# MatrixMath
A GitHub repo for the MatrixMath Arduino library - http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/MatrixMath

This Arduino library for Matrix Mathematical operations gives you all the basics in a lean package, up to in-place matrix inversion.
You will need to pay careful attention to matching matrix dimensions - this isn't Matlab!

### History

2016 Vasilis Georgitzikis / Package code into easy-install Arduino library. 

2013 Charlie Matlack / Add in-place matrix inverse function, very helpful in limited memory environment of Arduino, and general clean-up.

Unknown original author, Arduino form user RobH45345, posted code to Arduino playground.

### License

The original author didn't specify a License, but I'm going out on a limb and guessing that he implied GPL2.
